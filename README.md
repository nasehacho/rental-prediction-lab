## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand and apply the methodologies behind exploratory data analysis, cleaning data, and linear regression using python. Through applying the methodologies within this dataset, analysts are capable of understanding how to delete unwanted data and edit current data to effectively create a linear regression model. Within the linear regression model, analysts are able to predict the unit price of a rental property in this dataset. The linear regression model can also be applied to various types of data within industries like marketing to predict the efficacy of advertisements.

## Project Description
* Utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to complete this assignment
* Exploring the differences between data pre-cleaning and data post-cleaning
* Understanding the principles behind linear regression 
    * Regression explores the relationship amongst a plethora of variables to deduce conclusions that there is indeed a relationship with the variables in question
    * Linear Regression hypothesizes a linear relationship with the variables in question 
* Issues with python pickle module when serializing and saving linear regression model, possible de-bugging issue
